# interview-tips

A short guide to finding work after FAC. Here are some things I found out whilst interviewing and doing tests for jobs.


##Tests
The test I were given seemed to vary in length and difficulty, I was sent a couple of tests that were aimed at more mid level developers, I found these quite hard, and each took about 2 days to complete.
+ State which version of node you developed on in your readme (I developed on Node vs4 and some of the dependencies I used were not compatible with earlier versions of node, the company picked up on this).
+ Write a good FAC style readme, which details clearly how to run the project (if its a github repo).
+ Familiarise yourself with common design patterns (ie MVC)

I also completed some shorted test on [Codility](https://codility.com), I much preferred these as they did not take two days to complete (always nice :-) ). They have some practice examples which are helpful to go through.

##Interviews
+ Google language specific interview questions and have some answers prepared.
+ Also sell your soft skills gained at FAC i.e. working in teams, teaching each other and managing clients, I found that employers really liked this, and FAC has given us an excellent grounding in these skills.
+ If they throw you a problem you don't know the answer to (this happened to me), talk through how you would go about solving it, even if you don't know the answer.
+ Talk about how you learn new things (we have done lots of this at FAC so should be plenty to talk about).
+ Mention any extra-curricular activities (ie Node Girls, Hackathons, task-groups etc).
